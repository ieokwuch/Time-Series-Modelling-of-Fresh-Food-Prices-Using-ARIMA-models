# Time-Series-Modelling-of-Fresh-Food-Prices-Using-ARIMA-models
The price of food products is largely assumed to increase over time. In this study, an analysis is done for fresh food products to see how the prices behave and then an attempt is made to forecast future prices. The case study here is apples. In particular, we consider apple prices received by growers in the United States from 1980 till date. The data spans from January 1980 to August 2018 as this was the only period where there was consistent data for this particular product. The data is obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture Economic research Service. (USDA-ERS). The time series being analyzed here is a monthly time series. An exploratory data analysis is done to understand the characteristics of the data after which a confirmatory data analysis is done to confirm the initial inferences. ARMA models are fit to both the monthly time series, a forecasting experiment is done to check the model accuracy and minimum mean square error forecasts are used to predict future prices.
